			<h2>Beat your friends in chess!</h2>
			<p>
				I've been playing chess casually and competitively for 2 years, which has given me time to develop a lot
				of skills, not just in the game itself but in helping others
				learn how to play better. I've helped many friends improve and am currently trying to help my dad get up
				to rank 1000 from a complete beginner. I have gotten to rank
				1200, which is below professional rank but is above the 90th percentile. I'd be happy to teach anyone of
				any age, you just have to be willing to learn and adapt.
			</p>
			<p>
				It's important to start with the basics, and accept that you will make mistakes. Starting from the same
				basic principals that everyone needs can help you build into
				a player who can make make lethal tactical moves, or destroy your opponent positionally before you take
				a single piece.
